Jenkins Server Setup with Terraform
Project Description
This project provides a comprehensive guide and Terraform configuration files to automate the setup of a Jenkins server on AWS. Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server used to automate parts of the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying code.

By using Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool, this project allows you to provision and manage AWS infrastructure in a repeatable and consistent manner. The Terraform configuration includes the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, security groups, and an EC2 instance configured to run Jenkins.
